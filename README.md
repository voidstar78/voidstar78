Greetings!  I've been programming since 1986.

For more about me, see

Some of my hobbies have been: stone sculpting, astrophotography, 3D printing, vintage computing.  After my daughter was born, I learned to play Pokemon (which we did, up until tournmanets were canceled during COVID in 2020)!

We're all still coding by shoveling bytes around in text files, and that's just silly!   I think programming directly inside a VR interface will lead to the next generation of programming languages.  We had machine code, then assembly language, then high level languages.  UML, in my opinion, was a huge failure - in terms of, it didn't become the de-facto next paradigm in programming.  Not when you needed a plotter to print your diagrams!   But I will credit UML with one idea: there are useful annotations to code, but these should be "behind the code" -- i.e. "3D".   So we had syntax highlighting and then IntelliSense, those were all very helpful.   But another depth of information we need is how our declarations in code associate with other regions of the code.  Having quick insight to that information does three things: 1) how changes impact the codebase as a whole, 2) visually see where we need to efficiently use mutexes (or similar constructs) to avoid deadlocks, 3) help program management "see" the complexity of a project -- and where to spend resources (time/talent) in cleaning things up.
